<p>I have been reading andÂ practising data structures and algorithms for a while from various websites. Finally I tried to implement quicker quick sort implementation(I mean in terms of number of lines). Here is the code.</p>

{% highlight python %}

a = [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
def partition(ar):
    if ar == []:
        return []
    return partition([x for x in ar[1:] if x<ar[0]])+ar[0:1]+partition([x for x in ar[1:] if x>=ar[0]])

print partition(a)

{% endhighlight %}
