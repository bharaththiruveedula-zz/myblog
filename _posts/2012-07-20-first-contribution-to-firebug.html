<p>After a long time , I believe that this is the time to post a new one in my blog , because I made my first contribution to <a href="http://getfirebug.com">firebug </a>, which is famous addon for firefox and has the highest downloads in Mozilla Addon Website . The only person which made it possible is <a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/">Jan Honza Odvarko</a> . I am very thankful to Honza to help me out to made it . Actually my contribution is to solve the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=5592">bug</a> , which is enhancement bug , I actually made two context menus which when selected will copy the URL/POST parameters to users clipboard. But in the test case Honza wrote the test drive for me . Once again I am graceful to Honza who clarified my doubts patiently(silly though :P)</p>
