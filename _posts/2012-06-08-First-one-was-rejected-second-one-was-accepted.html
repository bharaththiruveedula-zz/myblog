<p>After 10 days of review the Mozilla Addons team reviewed by first addon and declared that my addon was rejected . They mention the reason  of rejection as “The addon Search for it was rejected because this feature is already present in latest versions of Firefox” . So I decided to make another addon as early as possible because they are a lot of time to review ,so I made a little changes to my previous addon and presented to Mozilla addon team for review this time I claimed for GPL license and after 10 days, today morning I received a mail from Mozilla saying that <p>

<strong>“Your add-on, Wiki It, initial.rev3, has been preliminarily reviewed by an editor and is now available for download in our gallery”</strong>

<p>So finally I added my addon to addons gallery . Feeling Happy!!!!!</p>
