<p>As I am a big fan of Mozilla firefox because of its addons , I want to develop an addon for firefox( though a simple one ) . I started learning how to create an addon for firefox from the great<a title="Addons developer site" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/addons" target="_blank"> mozilla developer site</a> , I then found three ways for creating an addon for firefox.</p>

<p>First one is the old manual way where you can create all the files and folders like chrome ,browser.js, locale ,chrome.manifest , install.rdf etc., I think though this method makes the developer aware of all the files he is developing to make an addon up and running but it takes a lot of time Â for writing the content which doesn't include the main logic of your addon.</p>

<p>Second is the creating an addon by using addon-sdk .It gaves you a lot of freedom for you to concentrate mainly on the code for functioning of your addon , rest of the things will take care by addon-sdk.</p>

<p>Third one is developing addon using addon-builder , it is lot easier than addon-sdk . You will code the addon on the cloud and you can test it with in a second and download the satisfied version of your addon.</p>

<p>I want to develop an addon using addon builder and I want to develop an addon which will search in google for the highlighted text , and developed the addon and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-for-it/" target="_blank">submitted</a> to mozilla addons website . Right now it is under review and waiting for it to release officially.</p>
